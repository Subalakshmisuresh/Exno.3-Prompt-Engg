Using a combination of scenario-based, straightforward, tabular format, and preceding question prompting techniques enhances precision, anticipation of user needs, and robust system resilience.
# 2. Project Overview
# Use Case Selection:
Local weather investigation for decision-making across sectors such as agriculture, tourism, education, and event planning.
# Scope:
Real-time data retrieval.
Short-term (hourly) and long-term (weekly) forecasting.
Customizable user notifications.
Data visualization and user trend reports.
# 3. Prompting Techniques for Each Stage of the Design Process
# Stage 1: Requirement Gathering and User Needs Assessment
# User Scenario Prompting:
"Imagine you are a parent planning a weekend outing. What weather details would you check before leaving?"
# Goal:
Capture real-world dependencies on weather such as temperature, UV index, wind speed, and rain probability.
# Straightforward Prompting:
"List the 3 most important weather details needed daily."
# Goal:
Obtain crisp, prioritized information (e.g., temperature, precipitation, humidity).
Tabular Format Prompting:
User Type	Weather Data Needed	Purpose
Farmer	Rain prediction, humidity	Irrigation scheduling
Student	Temperature, wind speed	Daily commute planning
Tourist	UV index, rainfall chances	Outdoor activity planning

# Goal:
Identify specific weather parameters based on user profiles.
# Preceding Question Prompting:
"Before checking the detailed forecast, what general weather conditions do you want to know first?"
# Goal:
Define information hierarchy for quick app navigation.
# Stage 2: System Design and Architecture
# Technical Scenarios for Component Design:
"Suggest an optimal backend structure that can fetch weather data every 15 minutes without overwhelming the server."
# Goal:
Establish a lightweight, scalable architecture using scheduled data pulls and serverless functions.
# Straightforward Prompting:
"What are the 5 core modules needed for a weather monitoring system?"
# Goal:
Ensure comprehensive module coverage (data retrieval, storage, processing, visualization, notification).
# Tabular Format Prompting:
Module Name	Functionality	Technology Stack
Data Fetcher	Retrieve live weather API data	Python + REST APIs
Database Manager	Store historical data	PostgreSQL/SQLite
Predictor Engine	Forecast using ML models	Scikit-learn / TensorFlow
UI/UX Interface	Display real-time weather info	React Native
Alert Manager	Send severe weather notifications	Firebase Cloud Messaging

# Goal:
Clarify technical blueprint and roles of each component.


# Preceding Question Prompting:
"Before deciding the database type, what factors (e.g., speed, storage, scalability) should be considered?"
# Goal:
Prioritize system attributes based on operational requirements.
# Stage 3: Prototype Development
# Scenario-Based Workflow Prompts:
"A user opens the app at 7 AM wanting today's rain prediction. Sketch the minimum steps needed."
# Goal:
Map fast, intuitive user pathways.
# Straightforward Prompting:
"List steps for viewing the 7-day forecast."
# Goal:
Standardize workflow: Home → 7-day forecast → Day Details.
Tabular Format Prompting:
Step No.	Action	Expected Outcome
1	Open App	Display Home Screen
2	Tap '7-Day Forecast' Button	Weekly forecast shown
3	Select a specific date	Detailed weather for that day

# Goal:
Visualize user journey stages.
Preceding Question Prompting:
"Before presenting the full forecast, should the app show a weather summary for today?"
# Goal:
Decide on pre-summary before deep-dive forecasts.



# Stage 4: Testing and Iteration
Stress Testing and Edge Case Prompts:
"What happens if 5,000 users simultaneously request severe storm alerts?"
# Goal:
Test system under extreme demand scenarios.
# Straightforward Prompting:
"Name 3 common failure points during bad weather API fetches."
# Goal:
Prepare for network downtime, API limit exceedance, and server crashes.
Tabular Format Prompting:
Potential Issue	Mitigation Strategy
API Downtime	Local caching + Retry Mechanism
Network Failure	Push local last-updated data
Load Spike	Implement Auto-scaling via AWS/GCP

# Goal:
Build robust contingency measures.

# Preceding Question Prompting:
"Before a user complains about outdated weather data, what fallback mechanisms should be activated?"
# Goal:
Improve user trust and system reliability.

# Stage 5: Deployment and Continuous Improvement
# Real-World Scenario Prompts:
"A sudden heatwave is expected next week. How should the system update users?"

# Goal:
Enable timely, clear, and non-intrusive user alerts.
# Straightforward Prompting:
"Mention 4 ways the app can keep growing user base post-deployment."
# Goal:
Focus on engagement strategies: gamification, rewards, personalized alerts, social sharing.
Tabular Format Prompting:
Growth Strategy	Implementation Example
Gamification	Reward badges for daily usage
Social Sharing	"Share Today’s Forecast" option
Personalized Forecasts	Custom notification settings
Community Feedback Loop	In-app surveys

# Goal:
Sustain user interest and growth.
Preceding Question Prompting:
"Before launching to new regions, what local weather differences must the app account for?"
# Goal:
Prepare for regional variations (e.g., monsoon alerts vs snowstorm warnings).

# 4. Evaluation of Prompt Effectiveness in Design
Accuracy and Specificity:
Straightforward, scenario-based, and tabular prompts enabled detailed identification of technical and user requirements.
Adaptability to User Needs:
Preceding question prompts helped anticipate dynamic user behaviors and environmental factors.

Flexibility in Design Adjustments:
The structured prompting strategies allowed agile modifications in prototype and system architecture.
# 5. Conclusion and Recommendations
# Summary:
Scenario-based, straightforward, tabular, and preceding question prompting approaches collectively strengthened the system design, improving forecast accuracy, user experience, and operational robustness.
Best Practices for Prompting:
Combine straightforward prompts for clarity.
Use tabular prompts for systematic requirement breakdown.
Apply preceding question prompts to anticipate next logical user/system actions.

### Future Prospects:
Future enhancements can include adaptive prompting models to further improve weather prediction and user interaction strategies.
Evaluation Metrics Used:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measuring prediction error.
R-Squared Score (R²): Evaluating the goodness of fit.
